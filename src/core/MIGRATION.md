# Migration Guide: Cline Refactoring

This document provides guidance on migrating from the original monolithic `Cline.ts` to the new modular architecture.

## Step 1: Review the New Architecture

Familiarize yourself with the new architecture by reviewing:
- `README.md` - Overview of the new architecture
- Each module's interface and responsibilities

## Step 2: Testing Strategy

Before replacing the original implementation:

1. Create unit tests for each module
2. Create integration tests for module interactions
3. Test the new `Cline` class with existing extension code

## Step 3: Implementation Plan

Follow this sequence for implementation:

1. Implement and test each module individually
2. Implement the new `Cline` class
3. Create a feature flag to toggle between old and new implementations
4. Test both implementations side by side
5. Once confident, switch to the new implementation

## Step 4: Updating Dependencies

Update any code that directly depends on the original `Cline` class:

1. Identify all direct dependencies
2. Update them to use the new interface
3. Ensure backward compatibility where needed

## Step 5: Refactoring the Original Cline.ts

To replace the original `Cline.ts` with the new implementation:

1. Rename `Cline.ts.new` to `Cline.ts` (we've already created a backup at `Cline.ts.backup`)
2. Update any imports in other files
3. Run the test suite to ensure everything works

## Current Status

The migration is currently in progress:

- ✅ Created module directory structure
- ✅ Implemented core modules (ApiManager, TaskManager, StateManager, ToolManager, UIManager, CheckpointManager)
- ✅ Created new Cline.ts.new file that orchestrates these modules
- ✅ Added documentation (README.md, MIGRATION.md, PR_SUMMARY.md)
- ✅ Created placeholder for ClineProvider.ts.new
- ❌ Fixed TypeScript errors in the implementation
- ❌ Implemented missing functionality
- ❌ Updated ClineProvider.ts to work with the new Cline class
- ❌ Replaced original Cline.ts with the new implementation
- ❌ Run tests to ensure everything works

## Next Steps

1. Fix TypeScript errors in the implementation
2. Implement any missing functionality
3. Update ClineProvider.ts to work with the new Cline class
4. Replace original Cline.ts with the new implementation
5. Run tests to ensure everything works

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Missing Functionality

If you find functionality in the original `Cline.ts` that isn't covered in the new modules:

1. Identify which module should own the functionality
2. Implement it in that module
3. Update the main `Cline` class to use it

### Interface Mismatches

If the new interface doesn't match what existing code expects:

1. Create adapter methods in the `Cline` class
2. Gradually update dependent code to use the new interface
3. Remove adapters once all dependencies are updated

### State Synchronization

Ensure state is properly synchronized between modules:

1. Use the `StateManager` as the single source of truth
2. Make sure all state updates go through it
3. Avoid storing duplicate state in multiple modules

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise during migration:

1. Keep the original `Cline.ts` file as a backup
2. Implement a feature flag to switch between implementations
3. Document the process for rolling back to the original implementation

## Timeline

Suggested timeline for the migration:

1. Week 1: Implement and test individual modules
2. Week 2: Implement and test the new `Cline` class
3. Week 3: Update dependencies and test integration
4. Week 4: Complete migration and remove old code
