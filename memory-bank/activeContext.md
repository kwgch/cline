# Cline Active Context

## Current Work Focus

The current focus is on improving the documentation for the Cline VSCode extension, particularly around the build process and creating VSIX packages for distribution. This includes:

1. Creating comprehensive build documentation in English and Japanese
2. Ensuring the documentation is accessible and well-integrated with existing docs
3. Setting up the memory bank system for better project documentation

## Recent Changes

### Documentation Improvements

1. **Build Documentation**
   - Added `docs/building.md` with detailed instructions on building the extension and creating VSIX packages
   - Added `docs/building-ja.md` with Japanese translation of the build documentation
   - Updated `docs/README.md` to include references to the new build documentation
   - Updated `README.md` to mention the build process in the "Local Development Instructions" section
   - Updated `locales/ja/README.md` to include a reference to the Japanese build documentation

2. **Memory Bank Setup**
   - Created the memory bank directory structure
   - Added core documentation files (projectbrief.md, productContext.md, systemPatterns.md, techContext.md, activeContext.md, progress.md)
   - Documented the project architecture, technical context, and product vision

### Code Changes

No significant code changes in the current work. The focus has been on documentation improvements.

## Next Steps

1. **Documentation Enhancements**
   - Review and potentially update other language versions of the README.md
   - Consider adding more detailed documentation on specific features
   - Improve MCP documentation with more examples and use cases

2. **Build Process Improvements**
   - Consider automating more of the build and packaging process
   - Add CI/CD pipeline for automated VSIX generation
   - Implement automated testing for the build process

3. **Feature Development**
   - Continue improving the browser automation capabilities
   - Enhance MCP integration with more built-in tools
   - Optimize token usage and context window management

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Documentation Strategy

1. **Multilingual Support**
   - Decision: Maintain core documentation in both English and Japanese
   - Consideration: Need to determine which other languages should be prioritized
   - Status: In progress, with English and Japanese as the initial focus

2. **Documentation Structure**
   - Decision: Use a hierarchical structure with README.md as the entry point
   - Consideration: Balance between comprehensive documentation and ease of navigation
   - Status: Implemented, but may need refinement based on user feedback

3. **Memory Bank Approach**
   - Decision: Implement a structured memory bank system for project documentation
   - Consideration: Ensure documentation stays up-to-date with code changes
   - Status: Initial implementation complete, needs ongoing maintenance

### Technical Considerations

1. **Build Process**
   - Decision: Use esbuild for fast and efficient bundling
   - Consideration: Balance between build speed and optimization
   - Status: Implemented and working well

2. **VSIX Packaging**
   - Decision: Use vsce for standard VS Code extension packaging
   - Consideration: Ensure compatibility with both VS Code Marketplace and Open VSX Registry
   - Status: Working as expected, documented in the new build guide

3. **Cross-Platform Support**
   - Decision: Ensure the extension works consistently across Windows, macOS, and Linux
   - Consideration: Handle platform-specific differences in file paths and terminal commands
   - Status: Generally working well, but ongoing attention needed for edge cases

## Current Challenges

1. **Documentation Maintenance**
   - Challenge: Keeping documentation in sync across multiple languages
   - Approach: Establish clear processes for documentation updates
   - Status: Being addressed with the current documentation improvements

2. **Build Complexity**
   - Challenge: The build process involves multiple steps and dependencies
   - Approach: Provide clear documentation and consider automation
   - Status: Improved with the new build documentation

3. **User Onboarding**
   - Challenge: Making it easy for new users to get started with Cline
   - Approach: Enhance documentation and provide clear examples
   - Status: Ongoing improvement effort
