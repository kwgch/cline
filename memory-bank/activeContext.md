   - Status: Strategy defined, implementation pending

4. **Build Process**
   - Decision: Use esbuild for fast and efficient bundling
   - Consideration: Balance between build speed and optimization
   - Status: Implemented and working well

5. **VSIX Packaging**
   - Decision: Use vsce for standard VS Code extension packaging
   - Consideration: Ensure compatibility with both VS Code Marketplace and Open VSX Registry
   - Status: Working as expected, documented in the new build guide

6. **Cross-Platform Support**
   - Decision: Ensure the extension works consistently across Windows, macOS, and Linux
