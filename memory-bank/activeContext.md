   - Updated `README.md` to mention the build process in the "Local Development Instructions" section
   - Updated `locales/ja/README.md` to include a reference to the Japanese build documentation

2. **Memory Bank Setup**
   - Created the memory bank directory structure
   - Added core documentation files (projectbrief.md, productContext.md, systemPatterns.md, techContext.md, activeContext.md, progress.md)
   - Documented the project architecture, technical context, and product vision

### Code Changes

No significant code changes in the current work. The focus has been on documentation improvements and architecture design.

## Next Steps

1. **State Management Implementation**
   - **Phase 1 (2 weeks)**: Implement core state container, actions, and reducers
   - **Phase 2 (1 week)**: Implement state persistence layer
   - **Phase 3 (2 weeks)**: Implement webview state management with React integration
   - **Phase 4 (2 weeks)**: Implement state synchronization between core and webview
   - **Phase 5 (3 weeks)**: Migrate existing components and add developer tools
   - See `memory-bank/state-management-refactoring.md` for detailed implementation plan

2. **Documentation Enhancements**
   - Review and potentially update other language versions of the README.md
   - Consider adding more detailed documentation on specific features
   - Improve MCP documentation with more examples and use cases

3. **Build Process Improvements**
   - Consider automating more of the build and packaging process
   - Add CI/CD pipeline for automated VSIX generation
   - Implement automated testing for the build process

4. **Feature Development**
   - Continue improving the browser automation capabilities
   - Enhance MCP integration with more built-in tools
   - Optimize token usage and context window management

5. **Project Improvements**
   - Implement improvements from the [improvement issues list](../docs/improvement-issues.md)
   - Prioritize high-impact enhancements
   - Address technical debt and architecture improvements

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Documentation Strategy

1. **Multilingual Support**
   - Decision: Maintain core documentation in both English and Japanese
   - Consideration: Need to determine which other languages should be prioritized
   - Status: In progress, with English and Japanese as the initial focus

2. **Documentation Structure**
   - Decision: Use a hierarchical structure with README.md as the entry point
   - Consideration: Balance between comprehensive documentation and ease of navigation
   - Status: Implemented, but may need refinement based on user feedback

3. **Memory Bank Approach**
   - Decision: Implement a structured memory bank system for project documentation
   - Consideration: Ensure documentation stays up-to-date with code changes
   - Status: Initial implementation complete, needs ongoing maintenance

### Technical Considerations

1. **State Management Architecture**
   - Decision: Adopt a Redux-inspired architecture with unidirectional data flow
   - Consideration: Balance between architectural purity and practical implementation
   - Status: Architecture designed, implementation planned

2. **State Synchronization**
   - Decision: Implement bidirectional synchronization with versioning
   - Consideration: Handle race conditions and ensure consistency
   - Status: Design complete, implementation pending

3. **Migration Strategy**
   - Decision: Use a phased approach with a compatibility layer
   - Consideration: Minimize disruption to existing functionality
   - Status: Strategy defined, implementation pending

4. **Build Process**
   - Decision: Use esbuild for fast and efficient bundling
   - Consideration: Balance between build speed and optimization
   - Status: Implemented and working well

5. **VSIX Packaging**
   - Decision: Use vsce for standard VS Code extension packaging
   - Consideration: Ensure compatibility with both VS Code Marketplace and Open VSX Registry
   - Status: Working as expected, documented in the new build guide

6. **Cross-Platform Support**
   - Decision: Ensure the extension works consistently across Windows, macOS, and Linux
   - Consideration: Handle platform-specific differences in file paths and terminal commands
   - Status: Generally working well, but ongoing attention needed for edge cases

## Current Challenges

1. **State Management Complexity**
   - Challenge: The current state management approach is complex and difficult to maintain
   - Approach: Implement a more structured state management system with clear patterns
   - Status: Architecture designed, implementation planned

2. **State Synchronization Issues**
   - Challenge: Keeping state in sync between core extension and webview
   - Approach: Implement robust synchronization with versioning and error recovery
   - Status: Design complete, implementation pending

3. **Migration Complexity**
   - Challenge: Migrating existing code to the new state management system without breaking changes
   - Approach: Use a phased approach with a compatibility layer
   - Status: Strategy defined, implementation pending

4. **Documentation Maintenance**
   - Challenge: Keeping documentation in sync across multiple languages
   - Approach: Establish clear processes for documentation updates
   - Status: Being addressed with the current documentation improvements

5. **Build Complexity**
   - Challenge: The build process involves multiple steps and dependencies
   - Approach: Provide clear documentation and consider automation
   - Status: Improved with the new build documentation

6. **User Onboarding**
   - Challenge: Making it easy for new users to get started with Cline
   - Approach: Enhance documentation and provide clear examples
   - Status: Ongoing improvement effort
