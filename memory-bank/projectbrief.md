# Cline Project Brief

## Project Overview

Cline is a VSCode extension that provides AI assistance through a combination of a core extension backend and a React-based webview frontend. The extension enables Claude 3.5 Sonnet's agentic coding capabilities to handle complex software development tasks step-by-step.

## Core Requirements

1. **File Operations**
   - Create and edit files with user approval
   - Monitor linter/compiler errors to proactively fix issues
   - Present diff views of changes for user review

2. **Terminal Integration**
   - Execute commands with user permission
   - Monitor command output in real-time
   - Support long-running processes

3. **Browser Automation**
   - Launch headless browser for testing and debugging
   - Interact with web pages (click, type, scroll)
   - Capture screenshots and console logs

4. **Project Analysis**
   - Analyze file structure and source code
   - Run regex searches across files
   - Read relevant files to understand context

5. **MCP Integration**
   - Support for Model Context Protocol
   - Create and use custom tools
   - Extend capabilities through MCP servers

## Project Goals

1. **Accessibility**
   - Provide a human-in-the-loop GUI for AI assistance
   - Make agentic AI capabilities accessible to all developers
   - Support multiple languages and platforms

2. **Safety**
   - Require explicit user approval for file changes and commands
   - Provide checkpoints for easy rollback
   - Maintain transparency in all operations

3. **Extensibility**
   - Support various API providers (OpenRouter, Anthropic, OpenAI, etc.)
   - Allow custom tools through MCP
   - Enable community contributions

4. **Performance**
   - Efficiently manage context window
   - Track token usage and costs
   - Optimize for large, complex projects

## Target Audience

- Software developers of all experience levels
- Teams working on complex codebases
- Individuals learning to code
- Organizations seeking to improve developer productivity

## Success Metrics

- User adoption and retention
- Task completion rate
- Time saved on development tasks
